    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is Delia Smith's iconic boiled egg recipe - enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>An Egg</ul>
    

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Before you start: don't boil eggs straight from the fridge! Give them time to adjust to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Use a kitchen timer or a stopwatch on your phone.</li>
    <li>Take a small saucepan.</li>
    <li>Fill it with enough water to cover the egg by 1cm.</li>
    <li>Bring the water to the boil and when the bubbles are breaking on the surface, gently add the egg.</li>
    <li>Switch the egg timer on and give the egg 1 minute's simmering time.</li>
    <li>Remove the pan from the heat, put a lid on it and set the timer again: 6 minutes for a soft-boiled egg, 7 minutes for a firmer yolk.</li>
